# OrderingRESTAPI


I have used Laravel 5.3 to create this rest API, I only uploaded the files which I used, not the whole framework.
Documentation:
  <b>routes/web.php</b> This file is where you may define all of the routes that are handled by the application.
  <b>Order.php</b> and <b>User.php</b> are Models, They are used to grab data from the database and pass them to the Controllers.
  <b>Http/Controllers/OrderController.php</b> This File is where most of the code is written, it is the controller which takes the input, check with the database using Models as stated above and then Returns a Json object.
